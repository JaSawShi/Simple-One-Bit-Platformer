## üìú Development & Inspiration
This project was inspired by a **Pygame platformer tutorial** by Russ:

**Changes from the tutorial:**
- **Grid size adjustment**
  - Original: 50x50 tiles in a **1000x1000** window (20x20 grid)
  - Mine: 16x16 tiles in a **128x128** grid, scaled 4x to **512x512**
- **New features added:**
  - Death counter display
  - Custom sprites and animations

This game was a fun challenge, and I enjoyed bringing it to life!
